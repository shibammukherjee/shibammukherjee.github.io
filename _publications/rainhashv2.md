Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems have developed rapidly in recent years, with hash functions as one of their central building blocks. Since these often dominate the prover cost, circuit-friendly hash function design has become an active research area. Most hash proposals target prime fields, although recent protocols such as Binius and VOLE-based ZK operate natively over binary extension fields . These binary field protocols reduce the cost of proving widely used binary and bitwise statements, thereby opening up new design opportunities. At the same time, the demand for ZK applications such as zkRollups is pushing towards performant hardware acceleration, a requirement that recent designs have largely neglected. Hence, a modern ZK hash function should also be efficient in hardware and fast in plain evaluation, to avoid new bottlenecks in non-circuit workloads.
In this paper, we introduce RainHash2.0, a cryptographic permutation that addresses both gaps. RainHash2.0 is natively defined over binary extension fields, making it a natural match for -based protocols such as Binius and VOLEitH, while being tailored for efficient hardware and competitive plain performance. To achieve this, we exploit new techniques from Binius to horizontally split the round function - arguably a novelty in itself that is particularly effective when finite fields of different sizes are used simultaneously. We implement RainHash2.0 in the Binius and VOLE-based ZK frameworks, comparing it against SHAKE, recent arithmetization-oriented designs, and its direct predecessor RainHash. Across proof size, prover- and verifier runtime, RainHash2.0 delivers significant improvements. In addition, we prototype RainHash2.0 on FPGA hardware and reach efficiency gains of up to 8.8 over related circuit-friendly hash functions. These results mark RainHash2.0 a practical choice for modern ZK applications.
